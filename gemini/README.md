# Gemini
Gemini AI is latest LLM from Google. Itâ€™s a multimodal model, capable of performing various tasks across different areas. It was jointly developed by Google and Alpha, with contributions from Google DeepMind. Gemini is compatible with various devices, such as computer, mobile etc. 
It is released in three sizes: 
- Gemini Nano
- Gemini Pro
- Gemini Ultra

I tested the APIs and combined them to create an AI assistant with image and text input. Specially for fruit analysis.

### Installation 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
### Run 
``` 
# streamlit run your_file_name.py

After running the script, Streamlit's UI should open in your default web browser.
